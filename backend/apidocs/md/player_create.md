## CreatePlayer handles the creation of a new player in the game.

It expects a **POST request with a JSON payload** containing the player's details. The payload **must include a valid GameID and a non-empty Name**. If the request method is not POST, it responds with a "method not allowed" error. If the payload is invalid or fails validation, it responds with a "bad request" error. On successful creation, it returns the created player data. In case of errors, it responds with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
